Walmart, a multinational retail giant, aims to analyze customer purchase behavior during Black Friday, specifically focusing on the purchase amount based on gender, marital status, and age groups. They want to understand if women spend more than men, and how other factors influence spending. The provided dataset contains transactional data of customers who made purchases during Black Friday.

My analysis will focus on exploring spending patterns for different customer segments and calculating confidence intervals for average spending. The insights gained will help Walmart make informed decisions and improve their strategies for Black Friday and beyond. We will provide actionable recommendations to optimize business performance.
